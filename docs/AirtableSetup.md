## Field Mapping

ZENITH automatically maps campaign data to your Airtable fields:

### Campaign Sync Mapping
- **Campaign Name** ‚Üí `Name` field
- **Campaign Description** ‚Üí Custom field or notes
- **Product Description** ‚Üí Custom field
- **Status** ‚Üí `Status` field (draft ‚Üí Planning, active ‚Üí Active)
- **Created Date** ‚Üí `Start Date` field
- **Tags** ‚Üí Custom field (comma-separated)
- **ZENITH Campaign ID** ‚Üí `ZENITH Campaign ID` field

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Fields
You can add custom fields to any table. ZENITH will automatically detect and sync additional fields when possible.

### Linked Records
The base structure uses linked records between tables for better data relationships:
- Contacts link to Companies
- Deals link to both Contacts and Companies
- This creates a complete CRM relationship structure

### Views and Filtering
Create custom views in Airtable to:
- Filter campaigns by status or date
- Sort deals by amount or close date
- Group contacts by company
- Track campaign performance over time

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**‚ùå "Invalid Base ID"**
- Verify your Base ID is correct (starts with "app")
- Ensure the base exists and you have access

**‚ùå "Permission Denied"**
- Check that your API token has the correct scopes
- Verify the base is added to your token's access list

**‚ùå "Table Not Found"**
- Ensure all required tables exist with exact names
- Table names are case-sensitive: "Contacts", "Companies", "Deals", "Campaigns"

**‚ùå "Field Not Found"**
- Check that all required fields exist in each table
- Field names must match exactly as specified above

### Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Test your connection using the built-in test feature
2. Check the browser console for detailed error messages
3. Verify your Airtable base structure matches this guide
4. Ensure your API token hasn't expired

## Security Notes

- API tokens should be treated as passwords - never share them
- Tokens can be regenerated if compromised
- Consider using workspace-level tokens for team access
- Review token permissions regularly
